# CORS Proxy Testing Guide

## Overview
The CORS proxy toggle feature has been successfully implemented in your CORSPlayground application. Here's how to test it:

## Features Implemented

### 1. UI Toggle Button
- Located in the Environment Configuration section
- Shows current state (Enabled/Disabled) with a badge
- Visual indicators:
  - **Green shield icon** when proxy is enabled
  - **Orange shield-off icon** when proxy is disabled
- Provides clear descriptions of each mode

### 2. Proxy Modes

#### **Proxy Mode (Enabled)**
- Requests are routed through `/api/proxy` endpoint
- Bypasses browser CORS restrictions
- Server makes the request on behalf of the client
- Can access any API regardless of CORS settings
- Default mode for development

#### **Direct Mode (Disabled)**
- Requests go directly from browser to target server
- Subject to browser CORS policy enforcement
- Server must allow your origin (http://localhost:2306)
- Useful for testing actual CORS configurations

### 3. Session Persistence
- Toggle state is saved in sessionStorage
- Persists across page refreshes
- Key: `corsplayground-cors-proxy`

## Testing Instructions

### Test 1: With CORS Proxy Enabled (Default)

1. Open the application at http://localhost:2306
2. Login with credentials:
   - Username: `Sohil`
   - Password: `sohil@123`
3. Ensure "CORS Proxy" toggle shows "Enabled"
4. Try calling your API at `http://localhost:3000/api/users`
5. **Expected Result**: Request should succeed even if the API has CORS restrictions

### Test 2: With CORS Proxy Disabled

1. Click the CORS Proxy toggle to disable it
2. The badge should show "Disabled"
3. Try calling the same API at `http://localhost:3000/api/users`
4. **Expected Result**: 
   - If the API has CORS restrictions, you should get a CORS error
   - Error message will suggest enabling the CORS proxy
   - If the API allows `http://localhost:2306`, request will succeed

### Test 3: Testing with Different APIs

#### Test with a public API (no CORS restrictions):
- URL: `https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users`
- Should work in both modes

#### Test with an API that has CORS restrictions:
- Your local API: `http://localhost:3000/api/users`
- Should only work with proxy enabled (unless CORS is configured to allow localhost:2306)

### Test 4: Verify Error Messages

1. Disable CORS proxy
2. Call an API with CORS restrictions
3. Check that the error message includes:
   - "Failed to fetch"
   - "This might be a CORS error. Try enabling the CORS proxy."

## Technical Implementation Details

### Modified Files:
1. **`/components/api-testing/environment-config.tsx`**
   - Added CORS proxy toggle integration
   - Session storage management

2. **`/components/api-testing/cors-proxy-toggle.tsx`**
   - UI component for the toggle
   - Visual feedback and descriptions

3. **`/lib/api-client.ts`**
   - Added `useProxy` parameter to ApiClient
   - Conditional routing (proxy vs direct)

4. **All request panels** (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE):
   - Updated to read CORS proxy setting from sessionStorage
   - Enhanced error messages for CORS issues

### How It Works:

1. **When Proxy is Enabled:**
   ```javascript
   Browser → /api/proxy → Target API
   ```
   - No CORS restrictions apply
   - Server-to-server communication

2. **When Proxy is Disabled:**
   ```javascript
   Browser → Target API (direct)
   ```
   - Subject to CORS policy
   - Browser enforces origin restrictions

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Toggle doesn't persist
- **Solution**: Check browser's sessionStorage settings
- Clear browser cache and try again

### Issue: Proxy mode still gets CORS errors
- **Check**: Ensure the proxy endpoint (`/api/proxy`) is working
- **Check**: Verify authentication is active

### Issue: Direct mode always fails
- **Expected**: This is normal if the target API has CORS restrictions
- **Solution**: Enable the proxy or configure the API to allow your origin

## Next Steps

1. Test with your specific API at `http://localhost:3000/api/users`
2. Verify both modes work as expected
3. Use proxy mode for development
4. Use direct mode to test production CORS configurations

## Summary

The CORS proxy toggle feature is now fully functional. It provides:
- Easy switching between proxy and direct modes
- Clear visual feedback
- Helpful error messages
- Session persistence
- Seamless integration with all HTTP methods

You can now test APIs with or without CORS restrictions, giving you full control over how requests are made from your application.
